# AssistantComputerControl - NOT MAINTAINED
Control your computer using your **Google Home**, **Amazon Alexa** and **Microsoft Cortana** assistants!

> [!WARNING]
> AssistantComputerControl has not been in development since 2023 - thanks to everyone who have used and supported the project! The website will be shutting down soon, but this GitHub repository will remain open and the **program can still be used**. Anyone are free to fork and revive the project.
> On Oct. 30th 2025 when this message was written, the project had **211515 downloads** via our website; the last download being just 3 minutes old; shutting down the website is something I've been dreading for years, but at a ~$45 monthly upkeep cost, it's time to say goodbye.

This software only works on Windows and has yet only been tested on Windows 10, 8 & 7.

## Install
Download via GitHub releases, found here; https://github.com/AlbertMN/AssistantComputerControl/releases/tag/1.4.6
Download [ACCsetup.exe](https://github.com/AlbertMN/AssistantComputerControl/releases/download/1.4.6/ACCsetup.exe)
~~Setting up AssistantComputerControl is a _piece of cake!_ It only takes about 2 minutes. You just [download the latest version](https://assistantcomputercontrol.com/) to your computer, open it and the setup guide will take you through the very short setup guide!~~

_Note: [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and a Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive account is required for the default setup. Dropbox will need to be running at all times for ACC to work_

## Adding actions
When the setup is done, all there's left to do is enable as many actions as you like! An "action" is executed on your computer, so enabling the "shutdown" action will allow you to shut down your computer using your assistant!

Scroll to the start of this article for a link-list of all the supported actions!
Or visit the ["Actions"](https://acc.readme.io/docs/actions) article in the Wiki for a more detailed look at what actions are, what they do and how they work.

If you want more freedom and set all of this up yourself you can do that! [Here](hhttps://acc.readme.io/docs/application-advanced-settings-expert-setup) is a guide on how to manually set up the software (also fairly simple), which allows you to decide where the software is on your computer and much more.

For more nerdy technical info you can go to the [Wiki](https://acc.readme.io/docs/) and take a look at the other articles as well.

So as you can see no coding is required! But if you're up for it and want to add your own features to the project it's easy! The entire project is made made in C# and the code is opensource and quite simple, so feel free to use the code in your own fork or even better; submit pull requests!

## Donations
**Project is abandonned. No further development of the project is planned.**
AssistantComputerControl is made by me, Albert, from Denmark, who enjoys developing it as a free time project. The project will remain free, but donations are welcomed as there are expenses such as hosting and the domain.
